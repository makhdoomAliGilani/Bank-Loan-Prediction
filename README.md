# Bank-Loan-Prediction
Data Mining project, implementing machine learning for Bank loan prediction. Using the public data set from LendingClub. The purpose of project is to implement a model which can predict whether loans are safe or not when given to any client. By this, Banks can decide whether they should give loans to clients or not.

# IMPLEMENTATION:
implementation done in two parts
1. Data Cleaning (dataset very large with unnecessary values, so it was necessary to perform data cleaning)
  data cleaning done in 4 steps
  a.	Selecting relevant features
  b.	Null value imputation
  c.	Creating dummy variables
  d.	Handling outliers (partially working)

2. Model training and evaluation
  a. Data preprocessing (working fine)
  b. training ML model (partially working)
  c. Evaluation Modle on test data (not working)
# NOTE 
due to large and heavy dataset and implementation complexity, unfortunately, i was unable to complete my project. however, i have coded upto MOdel training and evaluation.
# RUN
project implemented on colab. link is emailed to project supervisor as well as shared below:
Link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rcJ2OWYwJuPe3IkBS6510_nQmPstwnDR?usp=sharing
simple open the colab and run the code

# Web Application
I had committed a web application for this project, BUT, the backend is not yet completed and not working as intended. so it is useless to give web interface to incomplete backend application. that's why i did not created web app. :-(
